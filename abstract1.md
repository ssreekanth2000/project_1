For users of various substances, their exposure to and use of them varies greatly substance to substance. Only 40% of the people who have ever tried cocaine have used it in the past year but almost 60% of those who have tried heroin use it atleast once a week. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health dataset has extensive data which can allow us to view patterns and correlations in their usage. I have also explored how use patterns of different substances vary with the usage of cannabis to explore the assertion that it is a gateway drug. There are no definite conclusions drawn but interesting observations, like the fact that almost all people who have tried "harder" drugs have used cannabis  at an earlier age than non-users of hard drugs, are explored.
