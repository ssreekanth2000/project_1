**Drug use patterns and correlations**



One of the things that seemed interesting to me in the deabte on drugs usage is the details of patterns of use of various drugs and how they might correlate with those of other drugs.

I have mainly explored 2 questions in this analytical project. The first is various usage statistics of 4 different drugs, Cannabis, Alcohol, Cocain and Heroine. We can see the % of people who partake in their consumption, the age at which they have started to do so and also the frequency with which they do so.

**Cannabis usage**

Lets start from the basics and see how many people in the dataset have used cannabis

No of people in the dataset who have used cannabis 24022 and as a % 42.68


For the people who have used Cannabis, lets look at the age they have started do so in a histogram
