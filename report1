**Drug use patterns and correlations**



One of the things that seemed interesting to me in the deabte on drugs usage is the details of patterns of use of various drugs and how they might correlate with those of other drugs.
I have mainly explored 2 questions in this analytical project. The first is various uage statistics of 5 different drugs, Cannabis, Alcohol, Cocain and Heroine. We can see the % of people who partake in their consumptio, the age at which they have done so and also the frequency with which they do so.
