**Effects of Marijuana legalization on drug use**
by Sajjala Sreekanth Reddy

I am planning to use the NSDUH dataset. It is all ready and can be used immediatly.

The main ethical issues associated with the project is the issue of illegal narcotics involved. I must be very careful in order to not project
marijuana as something that should be encouraged. I shall stress on the point that it is still a federal crime to use these
substances with out a valid prescription. 


The **questions** I am looking to explore with this project are 

Does this data support the assertion that marijuna is a gateway drug?


Which drugs show the most correlation with marijuana use?


Correlation between alcohol(another legal substance) consumption and legalization of marijuna?


Change in usage of marijuana after legalization?
